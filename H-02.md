## H-02 Signatures can be replayed
## Summary

Signatures given to 3rd party to make them pay for gas fees are not secure and could be replayed.

## Vulnerability Details
The signatures used in rankCandidatesBySig do not use any form of uniqueness when creating them (nonce, salt etc..)
If a voter signs his orderedCandidates and gives it to a 3rd party, this 3rd party can reuse it at will (on the same round of voting or on the next ones).
Considering anyone can trigger the selectPresident, one 3rd party that was given some signatures in the past could fire transactions to use those signatures 
just before triggering the selectPresident timer. Making voting for those VOTERS useless as the 3rd party could always snipe them at the last time to change their vote to whatever the signature vote is.

## Impact
Rigged Votes

## Tools Used 
N/A

## Recommended Mitigation
Add a deadline and a nonce to the signatures. Keep track of those nonces to make sure they havent been used already.

```
    struct ReplayResistantMessage {
        address[] orderedCandidates;
        uint256 deadline;
        uint256 nonce;
    }

    mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) public noncesUsed;
    mapping(address => uint256) public latestNonce;

    function ReplayResistantRankCandidatesBySig(
        ReplayResistantMessage memory orderedCandidatesMessage,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external {
        bytes32 structHash = keccak256(abi.encode(TYPEHASH, orderedCandidatesMessage));
        bytes32 hash = _hashTypedDataV4(structHash);
        address signer = ECDSA.recover(hash, signature);
        _rankCandidates(orderedCandidatesMessage.orderedCandidates, signer);
    }
```
