## H-01 Voters can vote for address 0
## Summary

Voters can vote for address 0, this could result in a bad election here the address 0 is elected, blocking the contract for 4 years.

## Vulnerability Details
There are no checks either in _rankCandidates or _selectPresidentRecursive about the type of address given by the voters.
this could result in a bad election here the address 0 is elected, blocking the contract for 4 years.

## Impact
With enough voters doing this the contract could be unusable for 4 years.

## Tools Used 
N/A

## Recommended Mitigation

I suggest checking the orderedCandidates array given to us in _rankCandidates like so:

```  js
    function _rankCandidates(
        address[] memory orderedCandidates,
        address voter
    ) internal {
        // Checks
        if (orderedCandidates.length > MAX_CANDIDATES) {
            revert RankedChoice__InvalidInput();
        }
        if (!_isInArray(VOTERS, voter)) {
            revert RankedChoice__InvalidVoter();
        }

        //Here we check that none of the addresses are 0
        for (uint i = 0; i < orderedCandidates.length; i++) {
            if(orderedCandidates[i] == address(0)) {
                revert RankedChoice__InvalidInput();
            }
        }

        // Internal Effects
        s_rankings[voter][s_voteNumber] = orderedCandidates;
    }
```
